### Limitations
Modern web browsers do not let websites play sound without user interaction or
display bunch of popup dialogs, **so you need to interact
with the website (click around, allow popups etc.) in 
order to get the "full experience".**

And also you may want to turn down the volume!

When you are ready, [Click Here](https://virus-blond.vercel.app/main/VIRUS.html) to visit
the website

### How do I stop it???
Use `killall` command to kill your browser:
```bash
killall -9 firefox
```
Or use the task manager if you are on windows.
Another option is just to wait untill your browser or your computer crashes.
